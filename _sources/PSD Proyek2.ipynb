Algoritma ini bekerja dengan menggabungkan beberapa pohon keputusan (biasanya pohon yang dangkal) untuk meningkatkan performa prediksi.\n","\n","- **Leaf-Wise Splitting**: LightGBM menggunakan leaf-wise splitting, yang memungkinkan untuk membangun pohon dengan sedikit node yang lebih dalam. Ini berbeda dari level-wise splitting yang digunakan oleh banyak algoritma pohon keputusan lainnya.\n","\n","- **Histogram-based Learning**: LightGBM menggunakan histogram-based learning, yaitu mengelompokkan data menjadi interval nilai (histogram) untuk mengurangi kompleksitas perhitungan dan meningkatkan efisiensi.\n","\n","- **Parameter Kontrol Overfitting**: Anda dapat mengendalikan tingkat overfitting dengan mengatur parameter seperti `max_depth`, `min_child_samples`, dan lain-lain.\n","\n","- **Dukungan GPU**: LightGBM mendukung pelatihan pada GPU, yang dapat mempercepat proses pelatihan.\n","\n","### Arsitektur LightBGM\n","LightBGM membagi tree leaf-wise yang berlawanan dengan algoritma boosting lainnya yang menumbuhkan tree level-wise. Algoritma ini memilih daun dengan delta loss maksimum untuk tumbuh. Karena daunnya tetap, algoritma leaf-wise memiliki kerugian yang lebih rendah dibandingkan dengan algoritma level-wise. Pertumbuhan pohon secara leaf-wise dapat meningkatkan kompleksitas model dan dapat menyebabkan overfitting pada dataset yang kecil.\n","Di bawah ini adalah representasi diagram dari Pertumbuhan Pohon Bijaksana Daun:\n","\n","![LGBM](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200520035248/Leaf-Wise-Tree-Growth.png)\n","\n","\n","\n","### Rumus\n","\n","Secara umum, LightGBM tidak memiliki rumus matematis seperti yang dimiliki oleh beberapa algoritma lain seperti regresi linier. Namun, salah satu rumus utama yang digunakan dalam algoritma ensemble ini adalah rumus untuk perhitungan nilai prediksi dari sejumlah pohon keputusan:\n","\n","\n","$ \\hat{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x) $\n","\n","Di mana:\n","- $\\hat{y}$ adalah nilai prediksi.\n","- $n$ adalah jumlah pohon dalam ensemble.\n","- $f_i(x)$ adalah fungsi prediksi dari pohon keputusan ke-$i$ yang diaplikasikan pada data $x$.\n","\n","### Penggunaan\n","\n","LightGBM sangat cocok untuk dataset besar dan tugas klasifikasi atau regresi yang kompleks. Ini adalah salah satu algoritma yang populer dalam kompetisi data science dan digunakan dalam berbagai aplikasi machine learning."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"5ZxbxOuPerJ0"},"outputs":[],"source":["import lightgbm as lgb\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JCzJhOJGuGqF"},"source":["# **Parameter LightGBM**\n","\n","parameter pada inisialisasi metoode LightGBM adalah parameter yang digunakan untuk mengonfigurasi dan mengendalikan perilaku model LightGBM.
